The Economist Democracy Index is an annual ranking that measures the state of democracy in 167 countries. It assesses the quality of governance based on five key criteria: electoral process and pluralism, civil liberties, the functioning of government, political participation, and political culture. Countries are categorized into four types of regimes: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes, and authoritarian regimes.
